## 02 Initial Mark Up
The project is to create a form and build on it as we go along in order to test and practice my knowledge on a number of tasks.
First, provide the initial mark up with an iput field, a button and a li
all elements - should have an id and end with -el
Also, provide the CSS code and center these elements on the center of the page horizontally and vertically and go ahead and grab all the elements and declare the variables in JS. The variables should all have the same name as the elements, except they will not have a dash at the end and will end with "El" instead.
